telecom_loglog_rate_graph
=========================

What is it
----------

Draw loglog graphs of the downstream/upstream rates of ISP services, whith particular regions in the final graph
highlighted. 

I didn't find an easy way to generate appropriate diagrams that would have needed extensive hand-editing and
post-processing anyway, thus this tool.

This is not full-featured application. It is a Groovy script that generates the diagrams as bitmaps and

   * Displays them in a primitive window
   * Writes them to disk

Input data for the diagrams can be found in class `eu.qleap.smc_uhd.rateplot.desc.RateData`. Additional flexibility
is implemented by editing the source code!!

The relevant classes are here:

How to run it
-------------

The program can run on any OS as long as the following is installed:

   * [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) ;
   * [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/), i.e. the 'groovy-all.jar' must be on the Java CLASSPATH (see the [Groovy Quickstart](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Quick+Start)) ;
   * For the logging interface: [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) i.e. the 'slf4-api.jar' and 'jul-to-slf4j.jar' must be on the Java CLASSPATH ;
   * For the logging implementation: [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/), i.e. the 'logback-classic.jar' and 'logback-core.jar' must be on the Java CLASSPATH.

The repository is actually an Eclipse IDE project, so it can be directly imported. The needed jars are not provided though.
I will probably have to write a pom to pull these in at some point.

Example output
--------------

These are reduced versions of the diagrams generated by the unmodified code. 
Advertised downstream rates in "kbit/s" (1000 bit/s) are along the horizontal coordinate,
advertised upstream rates in "kbit/s" (1000 bit/s) are along the vertical coordinate.
The colored regions designate the various "Ultra-High-Speed" service levels:
